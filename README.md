# LaptopDisassembling

This is probably the most interesting computer that I have taken apart up to date. Disassembling old iMacs, or ages old Sun servers haven't given me such a *inner peace* :D

###Finding the specs of the laptop was surprisingly hard. Some **specifications** of the laptop that I was able to find are:
* 42 Megabyte hard disk drive   ![alt tag](https://github.com/ChathunKurera/LaptopDisassembling/blob/master/images/HDDback.jpg)
* Intel A80386DX-25 cpu (release date: 1988 April 4) ![alt tag](https://github.com/ChathunKurera/LaptopDisassembling/blob/master/images/CPU.jpg)

```

```
The vendor of the laptop is Zenith Data Systems. There was a sticker with the model number and some useful information.
The laptop has a seal inside its screen cover saying it was assembled on 4.April.1990 so this laptop really is 25 years old! Unfortunately, I was not able to turn on the computer but it is understandable.

The motherboard of the machine was behind the screen unlike modern laptops and surprisingly, there were no circuitry under the keyboard.

As you can probably guess, the screen was rather large in comparison to a modern laptop screen --> ![alt tag](https://github.com/ChathunKurera/LaptopDisassembling/blob/master/images/screenCompare.jpg)

Finally, one of the most neat things I found about this laptop was the keyboard was removable. So, if you ignore the huge rectangular block behind the screen, this will pretty much be a 25 year old tablet !!! ![alt tag](https://github.com/ChathunKurera/LaptopDisassembling/blob/master/images/removableKeyboard.jpg)
