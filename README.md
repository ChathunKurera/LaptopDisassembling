This is probably the most interesting computer that I have taken apart up to date. Disassembling old iMacs, or ages old Sun servers haven't given me such a *inner peace* :D

Finding the specs of the laptop was surprisingly hard. Some **specifications** of the laptop that I was able to find are:
* 42 Megabyte hard disk drive   ![alt tag}(https://github.com/ChathunKurera/LaptopDisassembling/blob/master/images/HDDback.jpg)
* Intel A80386DX-25 cpu (release date: 1988 April 4) ![alt tag](https://github.com/ChathunKurera/LaptopDisassembling/blob/master/images/CPU.jpg)
